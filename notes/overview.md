 - register within main.rs 

# Front End

UI Commponents

Step 1: Update Your Data Model üìù
Before creating any UI, you need to ensure your application's data structure matches the API specification.
File to Modify: src/lib/stores.ts.
Action: Find the Transaction interface and enhance it by adding new fields like transaction_hash, gas_used, and confirmations. You should also expand the status field to include values like 'failed' and 'submitted'.


Step 2: Create the New UI Components üèóÔ∏è
The analysis strongly recommends creating new files for this new functionality.
Files to Create:

 - src/lib/components/transactions/TransactionForm.svelte: A form for creating and sending new transactions.
 - src/lib/components/transactions/TransactionHistory.svelte: A component to display a list of past transactions.
 - src/lib/components/transactions/GasEstimator.svelte: A component to show real-time gas fee estimates.

Action: As you build these components, remember to reference your existing UI library (e.g., input.svelte, button.svelte) to maintain a consistent style and layout.

Step 3: Integrate into Your Pages üß©
Once the new components are ready, you need to add them to the main application view.

File to Modify: src/pages/Account.svelte.

Action: Import and place your new TransactionForm.svelte and TransactionHistory.svelte components within this page to make the transaction functionality available to the user.
