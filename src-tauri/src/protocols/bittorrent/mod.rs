//! # BitTorrent Protocol Implementation
//!
//! This module is responsible for handling file transfers using the BitTorrent protocol.
//!
//! In alignment with the Chiral Network's decoupled architecture, this module's
//! sole responsibility is data transfer. It is completely payment-agnostic.
//!
//! The main components will be:
//! - A `Handler` to manage peer connections and piece exchange.
//! - Logic to interact with the BitTorrent peer-wire protocol.
//! - Integration with the main Chiral DHT for initial peer discovery.
