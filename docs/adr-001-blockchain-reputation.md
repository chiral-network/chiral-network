# ADR-001: Blockchain-Based Reputation System

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Technical Story:** Implement tamper-proof peer reputation system using blockchain technology

## Context and Problem Statement

The Chiral Network currently uses a DHT-based reputation system that tracks peer behavior through local metrics. However, this approach has several limitations:

1. **Tamperability**: Local reputation data can be manipulated by malicious peers
2. **Lack of Consensus**: No global consensus on peer reputation across the network
3. **Sybil Attacks**: Malicious peers can create multiple identities to game the system
4. **No Immutable History**: Reputation data can be lost or modified without trace

We need a reputation system that provides:
- Tamper-proof reputation data
- Global consensus on peer behavior
- Immutable reputation history
- Protection against Sybil attacks
- Integration with existing peer selection algorithms

## Decision Drivers

- **Security**: Reputation data must be tamper-proof and verifiable
- **Scalability**: System must handle thousands of peers efficiently
- **Integration**: Must work with existing DHT and peer selection systems
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on network performance
- **Cost**: Reasonable transaction costs for reputation updates

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Pure DHT-Based Reputation
**Pros:**
- No external dependencies
- Low latency
- No transaction costs

**Cons:**
- Tamperable reputation data
- No global consensus
- Vulnerable to Sybil attacks
- No immutable history

### Option 2: Pure Blockchain-Based Reputation
**Pros:**
- Tamper-proof data
- Global consensus
- Immutable history
- Sybil attack resistance

**Cons:**
- High transaction costs
- Network dependency
- Higher latency
- Complex implementation

### Option 3: Hybrid DHT + Blockchain System (Chosen)
**Pros:**
- Combines benefits of both approaches
- Tamper-proof reputation epochs
- Efficient local caching
- Cost-effective batch updates
- Maintains existing DHT performance

**Cons:**
- More complex architecture
- Requires careful synchronization
- Additional infrastructure

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: Hybrid DHT + Blockchain System**

We will implement a hybrid reputation system that combines the efficiency of DHT with the security of blockchain:

### Architecture Overview

1. **Local DHT Layer**: Fast reputation tracking and peer selection
2. **Blockchain Layer**: Immutable reputation epochs with cryptographic proofs
3. **Synchronization Layer**: Periodic batch updates to blockchain

### Key Components

#### Reputation Events
```rust
pub struct ReputationEvent {
    pub peer_id: String,
    pub event_type: ReputationEventType,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub signature: String,
}
```

#### Reputation Epochs
```rust
pub struct ReputationEpoch {
    pub epoch_id: u64,
    pub start_time: u64,
    pub end_time: u64,
    pub events: Vec<ReputationEvent>,
    pub merkle_root: String,
    pub signature: String,
}
```

#### Merkle Tree Verification
- Cryptographic proof of event integrity within epochs
- Efficient verification of individual events
- Tamper-proof event ordering

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Design and documentation (this ADR)
2. **Phase 2**: Core reputation system implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Blockchain integration
4. **Phase 4**: Frontend integration
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and optimization

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Tamper-proof reputation data** through blockchain immutability
- **Global consensus** on peer reputation across the network
- **Immutable reputation history** for audit and analysis
- **Sybil attack resistance** through cryptographic identity verification
- **Efficient local performance** maintained through DHT caching
- **Cost-effective updates** through batch epoch submissions

### Negative
- **Increased complexity** in system architecture
- **Additional infrastructure** requirements (blockchain node)
- **Transaction costs** for reputation updates
- **Network dependency** on blockchain connectivity
- **Synchronization challenges** between DHT and blockchain layers

### Risks
- **Blockchain network failures** could impact reputation updates
- **High transaction costs** during network congestion
- **Complex debugging** due to multi-layer architecture
- **Performance degradation** if synchronization is inefficient

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Continue using DHT-only mode if blockchain is unavailable
2. **Cost Optimization**: Batch multiple events into single transactions
3. **Caching Strategy**: Maintain local reputation cache with periodic blockchain sync
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics for both layers
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement with feature flags for safe deployment

## Implementation Notes

### Security Considerations
- Private key management with encryption and zeroization
- Secure event signing and verification
- Protection against replay attacks
- Rate limiting for reputation updates

### Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous blockchain operations
- Efficient Merkle tree construction
- Local caching with TTL
- Batch processing for cost optimization

### Integration Points
- Existing peer selection algorithms
- DHT service integration
- Frontend reputation display
- Network monitoring systems
