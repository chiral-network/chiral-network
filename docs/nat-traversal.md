# NAT Traversal & Network Reachability

Chiral Network implements comprehensive NAT traversal solutions to ensure connectivity between peers regardless of network configuration.

## Understanding NAT Traversal Protocols

### AutoNAT v2 vs Circuit Relay v2

These are two **independent** libp2p protocols serving different purposes:

**AutoNAT v2** (Reachability Detection):
- **Does NOT require relay** - completely independent protocol
- **Purpose**: Detects if your node is behind NAT (Public/Private/Unknown status)
- **How it works**: Other peers try to dial you back directly on your observed addresses
- **Security**: Cannot use relay connections for dial-back (libp2p security requirement)
- **Built-in libp2p protocol**: Enable by configuring AutoNAT behavior in NetworkBehaviour

**Circuit Relay v2** (NAT Traversal):
- **Requires publicly reachable relay nodes**
- **Purpose**: Forwards traffic between NAT'd peers who cannot connect directly
- **How it works**:
  - NAT'd peer (A) requests reservation with relay (R)
  - Relay R listens for incoming connections on A's behalf
  - When peer B wants to connect to A, B connects to relay R, which relays traffic
- **End-to-end encrypted**: Relay cannot read or tamper with traffic (inspired by TURN protocol)
- **Built-in libp2p protocol**: Enable by configuring relay behavior in NetworkBehaviour
- **Decentralized**: Any public node can opt-in to relay mode

**Key Takeaway**: Both are core libp2p features - no third-party services needed. The relay is simply running libp2p relay protocol, not a centralized service.

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Phase 1: NAT Traversal Infrastructure (Completed)
- Circuit Relay v2 implemented and tested across different networks
- AutoNAT v2 for reachability detection
- Relay server mode (any public node can act as relay)
- Cross-network connectivity verified through relay circuits

**Current State**: Peers can communicate through relay, but requires **manual multiaddress sharing** (peer-ID discovery).

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Content-Based Discovery (Next Step)
- **Goal**: Automatic peer discovery by file hash using DHT
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - When sharing a file: `put_record("file:SHA256_HASH", peer_relay_circuit_address)`
  - When searching for a file: `get_record("file:SHA256_HASH")` returns peer addresses
  - NAT'd peers publish their relay circuit addresses to DHT
- **Result**: Fully decentralized P2P file sharing - no manual address exchange needed

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Optimization (Future)
- WebRTC direct connections after initial relay handshake
- DCUtR (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay) for hole punching
- Relay as fallback only, not primary transfer method

```bash
# Enable AutoNAT with custom probe interval
./chiral-network --autonat-probe-interval 60

# Disable AutoNAT
./chiral-network --disable-autonat

# Add custom AutoNAT servers
./chiral-network --autonat-server /ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/QmPeerId

# Enable AutoRelay with custom relay nodes
./chiral-network --relay /ip4/relay.example.com/tcp/4001/p2p/QmRelayId

# Route P2P through SOCKS5 proxy
./chiral-network --socks5-proxy 127.0.0.1:9050
```

## NAT Traversal Architecture

The network uses a multi-layered approach to ensure connectivity:

### 1. Direct Connection (fastest)
For publicly reachable peers with no NAT or firewall restrictions.

### 2. Hole Punching (DCUtR)
For symmetric NAT traversal using Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay protocol.

### 3. Circuit Relay (fallback)
For restrictive NATs where hole punching fails. Connections are relayed through trusted relay nodes.



## Deploying Your Own Relay Node

For testing NAT traversal or contributing relay infrastructure to the network, you can deploy your own relay node:

### Quick Start

The relay daemon (`chiral-relay`) is located in `relay/` directory. Basic usage:

```bash
cd relay
cargo build --release
./target/release/chiral-relay --port 4001 --external-address /ip4/YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/tcp/4001
```

### Cloud Deployment

For production relay deployment on cloud providers (Google Cloud, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.), see:

**[relay/DEPLOYMENT.md](../relay/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Complete deployment guide including:
- Cloud provider setup (GCP, AWS, DigitalOcean)
- Firewall configuration
- systemd service setup
- Docker/docker-compose configs
- Monitoring and metrics

### Configure Relay in Main App

After deploying a relay, configure it in your Chiral Network app:

1. Copy the relay's full multiaddr: `/ip4/YOUR_IP/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...`
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Network Settings**
3. Paste multiaddr into **Preferred Relay Nodes**
4. Enable **AutoRelay** toggle
5. Save and restart DHT
