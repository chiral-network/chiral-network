# Chiral Network - Decentralized P2P File Sharing Platform

## Overview

Chiral Network is a BitTorrent-like decentralized file sharing application designed for legitimate personal and organizational use. Built with Svelte, TypeScript, and Tauri, it provides a modern desktop experience for peer-to-peer file sharing focused on privacy, security, and efficient data distribution. The platform operates on a continuous seeding model where files are instantly available to the network once added, similar to BitTorrent's architecture.
